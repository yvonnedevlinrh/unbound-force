# Using Unbound Force

## Start OpenCode

Navigate to your project and start OpenCode:

```bash
opencode
```

## Modes and Agents

OpenCode has two interaction layers: **primary modes**
you switch between, and **subagents** invoked by
commands.

### Primary Modes (Tab to switch)

| Mode | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Build** | Makes changes -- the default mode for development |
| **Plan** | Read-only analysis and planning -- no file modifications |

Press **Tab** to cycle between modes. Use Plan to think
through an approach, then switch to Build to execute.

### Subagents (invoked via slash commands)

Subagents are specialized agents invoked automatically
by slash commands. You rarely need to call them directly.

| Agent | Invoked by | Role |
|-------|-----------|------|
| `cobalt-crush-dev` | `/cobalt-crush` | Developer persona |
| `divisor-*` (9 agents) | `/review-council` | Review council personas |
| `muti-mind-po` | `/muti-mind.*` | Product owner |
| `mx-f-coach` | `@mx-f-coach` | Coaching and retrospectives |
| `gaze-reporter` | `/gaze` | Quality analysis |
| `gaze-test-generator` | `/gaze-fix` | Test generation |

To invoke a subagent directly, type `@` followed by
the agent name in your message.

## Common Workflows

### Review Code

```
/review-council
```

Runs 9 AI reviewer personas in parallel. Each focuses
on a different aspect (security, architecture, testing,
operations, intent drift). You receive an **APPROVE** or
**REQUEST CHANGES** verdict with specific findings. The
council auto-detects whether to review code or specs
based on what changed on your branch.

### Propose a Change (Small)

For bug fixes, minor enhancements, and tasks under 3
user stories:

```
/opsx-propose <describe what you want to change>
```

This creates a proposal, design, and task list in one
step. Then implement and finalize:

```
/opsx-apply
/finale
```

`/finale` commits, pushes, creates a PR, watches CI, and
merges.

### Build a Feature (Large)

For features with 3+ user stories, use the Speckit
pipeline:

```
/speckit.specify <describe the feature>
        |
        v
/speckit.plan          generate implementation plan
        |
        v
/speckit.tasks         break into ordered task list
        |
        v
/speckit.implement     execute the tasks
        |
        v
/finale                commit, push, PR, merge
```

Optional intermediate steps: `/speckit.clarify` (refine
the spec), `/speckit.analyze` (consistency check),
`/speckit.checklist` (quality validation).

### Go Fully Autonomous

```
/unleash
```

Runs the full pipeline autonomously: clarify, plan,
tasks, spec review, implement, code review, and
retrospective. Works with both Speckit (`NNN-*` branches)
and OpenSpec (`opsx/*` branches). Exits to human
judgment only when it encounters ambiguity, review
failures, or merge conflicts.

### Explore Ideas

```
/opsx-explore
```

Enters a thinking mode for exploring ideas,
investigating problems, and clarifying requirements
before committing to a change. Read-only — no file
modifications.

### Check Code Quality (Go Projects)

```
/gaze
```

Produces CRAP scores, coverage metrics, side effect
classifications, and overall project health. Then
generate tests for the weakest spots:

```
/gaze-fix
```

### Persistent CDE with DevPod

Set up a persistent development environment using
DevPod and the devcontainer spec:

```bash
uf sandbox init                          # scaffold devcontainer.json
uf sandbox create --backend devpod       # create workspace
uf sandbox start                         # resume workspace
uf sandbox stop                          # pause workspace
uf sandbox destroy                       # remove workspace
```

DevPod workspaces persist across sessions and run
directly in Podman -- no Kubernetes required. The
gateway proxy auto-starts when a cloud LLM provider
is detected, injecting credentials into the workspace.

## When to Use What

| Situation | Workflow | Start with |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Bug fix or small task | OpenSpec | `/opsx-propose` |
| New feature (3+ stories) | Speckit | `/speckit.specify` |
| "Handle everything" | Either | `/unleash` |
| Code review | Standalone | `/review-council` |
| Quality check (Go) | Standalone | `/gaze` |

## Customization

Convention packs define coding standards that review
agents enforce. After `uf init`, find them at:

```
.opencode/uf/packs/
  default.md          # language-agnostic (tool-owned)
  default-custom.md   # your project extensions
  severity.md         # severity definitions (tool-owned)
  go.md               # Go conventions (tool-owned)
  go-custom.md        # your Go extensions
  content.md          # writing standards (tool-owned)
  content-custom.md   # your content extensions
  typescript.md       # TypeScript conventions (tool-owned)
  typescript-custom.md # your TypeScript extensions
```

Edit the `*-custom.md` files to add project-specific
rules. Tool-owned files are auto-updated by `uf init`;
custom files are never overwritten.

## CLI Commands

Unbound Force also provides terminal CLI commands
outside of OpenCode:

- `uf init` -- scaffold the framework into your project
- `uf doctor` -- diagnose your development environment
- `uf setup` -- install the full toolchain
- `uf sandbox` -- manage containerized dev sessions
- `uf gateway` -- start/stop the LLM reverse proxy
- `uf config` -- manage .uf/config.yaml

See **[CLI Reference](cli-reference.md)** for full
command documentation with flags and examples.

The `mutimind` CLI provides terminal-based backlog
management. See **[CLI Reference](cli-reference.md#mutimind)**
for details.
